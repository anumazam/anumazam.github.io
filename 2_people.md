I am an incoming assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I grew up on the Jersey Shore. As an undergraduate in the [Gracias Lab](https://graciaslab.johnshopkins.edu/), I built self-folding micro-structures. In graduate school, I studied nature's most beautiful self-folding systems -- proteins -- in the [DTE Lab](https://dtelab.northwestern.edu/) at UC Berkeley. For the last few years, I moved into computational biophysics to design new proteins for artifical functions as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kortemme Lab](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. I am so pumped to do protein science in NYC!!

I am a third-year undergraduate student working towards a B.A. in Biochemistry. I was born in BÃ³gota, Colombia, and moved to the US 6 years ago. I lived in Miami, Florida, and obtained my Associate Degree in chemistry at Miami Dade College. There, I worked with Dr. Juan Morata where I became fascinated with viruses and their ability to hack biological mechanisms. Currently, I am learning about protein engineering and computational biology; I am extremely excited to keep studying proteins! Outside the lab, I enjoy reading, playing, and developing videogames, skateboarding, and museums!
