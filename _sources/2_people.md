I am an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I grew up on the Jersey Shore. As an undergraduate in the [Gracias Lab](https://graciaslab.johnshopkins.edu/), I built self-folding micro-structures. In graduate school, I studied nature's most beautiful self-folding systems -- proteins -- in the [DTE Lab](https://dtelab.northwestern.edu/) at UC Berkeley. For the last few years, I moved into computational biophysics to design new proteins for artifical functions as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kortemme Lab](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. I am so pumped to do protein science in NYC!!

I am a PhD student in the Integrated Program of Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia. I’m coming directly from my undergraduate studies in Biology at New Mexico State University. As an undergraduate MARC Fellow in the Curtiss Lab, I used fruit flies as a model to study protein interactions during development. Before coming to NYC, I spent a virtual summer at UCSF developing computational approaches to analyze archaeal replication in the Gross Lab. At Columbia, I am excited to continue studying proteins and their associations to health and disease.

I am a third-year undergraduate student working towards a B.A. in Biochemistry. I was born in Bógota, Colombia, and moved to the US 6 years ago. I lived in Miami, Florida, and obtained my Associate Degree in chemistry at Miami Dade College. There, I worked with Dr. Juan Morata where I became fascinated with viruses and their ability to hack biological mechanisms. Currently, I am learning about protein engineering and computational biology; I am extremely excited to keep studying proteins! Outside the lab, I enjoy reading, playing, and developing videogames, skateboarding, and museums!

I am a PhD student in the Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies Program at Columbia. I received my B.S. in Computational & Applied Mathematics & Statistics at William & Mary, where I competed in the iGEM synthetic biology competition. I am interested in synthetic biology and protein engineering.

I am currently a Research Assistant in the Glasgow lab and soon to be PhD student in the Integrated Program of Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia. I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida in Biotechnology as well as a minor in Bioinformatics. My previous research focused on mitigating the effects of citrus greening, a bacterial pathogenic infection, in citrus plants. I specialized in RNA-Seq experiments, genome assemblies, and isoform discovery to uncover mechanisms of resistance. My current interests are in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. I wish to create novel enzymes and transcription factors for the use in synthetic systems.

I am a second-year PhD student in physics at Columbia. I did my undergrad also in physics at Columbia, and before starting here I did research in condensed matter physics and genomics labs. I am excited about protein biophysics and currently studying allostery using HDX mass spectrometry.
