**5/26/21** The Glasgow Lab is HERE ðŸ˜Ž

It's been a great first semester!

Some updates:
- our lab is a member of the [Rosetta Commons](https://www.rosettacommons.org/)
- we had some lab renovations and got equipment
- our first two rotation students, Kyle Helms and Julia Urban, joined us in January and left us in April. We miss them and their fantastic science
- our next batch of rotation students, Andrew Reckers and Belen Sundberg, joined us in April. They are really awesome
- after optimizing and troubleshooting for a couple months, Malcolm collected our first large HDX/MS datasets
- Daniel got an Amgen scholarship for summer research
- Daniel, Kyle W. and Anum completed Columbia's [Lab-to-Market bootcamp](https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/services/life-science-accelerator-lab-market-boot-camp)
- we tested our first designed proteins
- we applied for grants
- we all gave our first group meetings
- Daniel and Kyle W. learned a lot at pyrosetta bootcamp
- we triumphed/survived some plasmid contamination issues and rampant COVID

We're excited to go hard this summer to advance our ongoing basic science, applied, and methods development research projects!
