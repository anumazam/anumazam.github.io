Anum Glasgow is an incoming assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/). Anum grew up on the Jersey Shore. She immersed herself in research as an undergraduate in the [Gracias Lab](https://graciaslab.johnshopkins.edu/) building self-folding micro-structures. In graduate school, she studied nature's most beautiful self-folding systems -- proteins -- in the [DTE Lab](https://dtelab.northwestern.edu/) at UC Berkeley. For the last few years, Anum moved into computational biophysics to design new proteins for artifical functions as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kortemme Lab](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. Anum is pumped to do protein science in NYC!!
