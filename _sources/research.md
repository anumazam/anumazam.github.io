# Research

The diversity of natural proteins shapes cell- and tissue-level structure and behavior, and advances in protein engineering have enabled the *de novo* design of artificial, super-stable proteins. But real proteins have evolved to depend on biomolecular interactions and conformational flexibility in order to balance stability with function. A *key challenge* in protein engineering is our limited mechanistic understanding of how proteinsâ€™ conformational ensembles are poised to perform non-equilibrium processes, which enable their functions.

**Our research group combines computational protein design with high-throughput biophysical techniques to study biomolecular conformational changes, towards engineering proteins that change conformations, interact with other molecules, and cross membranes in response to signals.** Design principles for building signal-responsive, semi-stable proteins can guide efforts to control the behavior and development of living systems and treat diseases without disrupting healthy cells.

Our *long-term goal* is to engineer multi-functional proteins and therapeutics that respond to ligand binding and correct localization via programmed conformational changes. This work serves the public by growing our knowledge of biomolecular behavior and opening new paths to treat disease.

### Mapping and engineering signal transduction in allosteric proteins.
Protein allostery is defined as a perturbation at one site in a protein that causes a functional change at a distal site. Cell signaling depends ubiquitously on allostery, and a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon is key to decoding biological regulation in normal and diseased states. A high-resolution picture of signal transduction in a protein represents a roadmap for designing allosteric drugs targeting that protein. The *main limitation* in uncovering allosteric mechanisms in proteins is that established techniques may not provide enough information about protein structure and dynamics to detail all of the changes caused by perturbations.

How are allosteric conformational changes that drive function encoded in protein families? Do conserved intramolecular contacts in homologous proteins enable common conformational changes in response to allosteric perturbations? To answer these questions, we are building a high-throughput platform for precisely tuning thermodynamically coupled residue interactions in proteins towards a generalizable model of allostery, by studying *allostery in related proteins*. We are also precisely engineering *new allosteric proteins* using biophysical methods and computational design approaches.

### Engineering protein-protein interactions for new therapeutic scaffolds.
Effective protein therapeutics rely on strong, specific, well-regulated protein-protein interactions, but the design of such interactions *de novo* still represents a fundamental challenge. We will combine the fundamental question of how to build new protein binders with the critical need to develop robust platforms for rapid response to viral infections, towards versatile and generalizable therapeutic scaffolds.
