The diversity of natural proteins shapes cell- and tissue-level structure and behavior, and advances in protein engineering have enabled the *de novo* design of artificial, super-stable proteins. But real proteins have evolved to depend on biomolecular interactions and conformational flexibility in order to balance stability with function. A key challenge in protein engineering is our limited mechanistic understanding of how proteinsâ€™ conformational ensembles are poised to perform non-equilibrium processes, which enable their functions.

**Our research group combines computational protein design with high-throughput biophysical techniques to study biomolecular conformational changes, towards engineering proteins that change conformations, interact with other molecules, and cross membranes in response to signals.** Design principles for building signal-responsive, semi-stable proteins can guide efforts to control the behavior and development of living systems and treat diseases without disrupting healthy cells. Our long-term goal is to engineer multi-functional proteins and therapeutics that respond to ligand binding and correct localization via programmed conformational changes. This work serves the public by growing our knowledge of biomolecular behavior and opening new paths to treat disease.
