```{sidebar} Principal investigator
Anum Glasgow is an incoming assistant professor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/). Anum got excited about research as an undergraduate in the [Gracias Lab](https://graciaslab.johnshopkins.edu/) building self-folding micro-structures. She switched fields in graduate school, studying nature's most beautiful self-folding systems -- proteins -- in the [DTE Lab](https://dtelab.northwestern.edu/) at UC Berkeley. For the last five years, Anum moved into computational biophysics to design new proteins for artifical functions as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kortemme Lab](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. Anum has a lot of fun doing protein science and is pumped to start her lab!
